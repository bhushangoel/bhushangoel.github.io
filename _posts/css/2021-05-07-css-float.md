`float` is mainly used to create a column layout without the use of tables. A column layout can be easily created by
using float properties without needing to use positions at all.

Apart from that one of the most common uses for the float
property is to float an image with text wrapping it.

The purpose of the CSS `float` property is, to push a `block-level` element to the left or right,
taking it out of the flow in relation to other block elements. This allows naturally-flowing content to wrap around the floated element.
The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.

## Syntax
`float` can have 4 valid values:
- left,
- right,
- none,
- inherit.

The most commonly-used values are `left and right`. A value of `none` is the default.

A floated element should have an explicitly set width to ensure that ii behaves as expected
