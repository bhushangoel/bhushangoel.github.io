`this` is basically a function context and its value depends on the style of function invocation.

## For methods

It is methodâ€™s own object.

```javascript
var hero = {
    _name: 'John Doe',
    getSecretIdentity: function () {
        return this._name;
    }
};

var stoleSecretIdentity = hero.getSecretIdentity;

console.log(stoleSecretIdentity()); // undefined
console.log(hero.getSecretIdentity());  // "John Doe"
```

The first `console.log` prints `undefined` because we are extracting the method from the hero object, so `stoleSecretIdentity()` is being invoked in the global context \(i.e., the `window` object\) where the `_name` property does not exist.

One way to fix the `stoleSecretIdentity()` function is by using [bind\(\)](https://github.com/bhushangoel/frontend-notes/tree/83e17aa1b78f31cce9894bbdb6be0208f3d7567e/implementations/bind.md):

`var stoleSecretIdentity = hero.getSecretIdentity.bind(hero);`

## For top-level functions

It is either equivalent to -

* `window`\(non-strict mode\) or
* `undefined`\(strict mode\)

## For constructors

It is a newly created object instance.
