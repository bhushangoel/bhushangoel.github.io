What value will be displayed in the console?

```javascript
var arr = [];
arr[0] = 'a';
arr[1] = 'b';
arr.foo = 'c';

console.log(arr);   // ?
console.log(arr.foo);   // ?
console.log(arr.length);    // ?
```

## Solution:

```javascript
var arr = [];
arr[0] = 'a';
arr[1] = 'b';
arr.foo = 'c';

console.log(arr);   // ['a', 'b', foo: 'c'];
console.log(arr.foo);   // 'c'
console.log(arr.length);    // 2
```

`Arrays` in JavaScript are `objects` plus a few methods and properties\(`length`\). That is why they can have object properties.

But those are not considered as part of the actual array.

_Therefore, in this example -_

`arr` is equal to `['a', 'b', foo: 'c']`

But, `arr.length` is 2 and not 3 because `length` property only tracks the highest numeric index within an array. It doesn't loop over an array to count the number of elements.
