What will get printed in `console.log()`?

## Q1:

```javascript
"use strict"
let x = 1;
let x = 2;
console.log(x); // ?
```

## Solution:

```javascript
"use strict"
let x = 1;
let x = 2;
console.log(x); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
```

`let` and `const` were introduced in ES6\(2015\) version. They are used to declare a `block-scoped` variables and redeclaring a block-scoped variable in the same scope is not allowed in ES6

## Q2:

```javascript
"use strict"
var x = 1;
var x = 2;
console.log(x); // ?
```

## Solution:

```javascript
"use strict"
var x = 1;
var x = 2;
console.log(x); // 2
```

Variables declared using `var` keyword can be redeclared using `var` keyword only.

Variables declared using `var` keyword can be redeclared using `var` keyword only. It doesn't matter if we are using `strict mode` or not.
