### What will be the output?

```javascript
    var obj = {a: 5};
    var obj2 = Object.create(obj);
    delete obj2.a;

    console.log(obj2.a);    //?
```

## Solution:

```javascript
    var obj = {a: 5};
    var obj2 = Object.create(obj);
    delete obj2.a;

    console.log(obj2.a);    //5
```

**There are two things happening here -**

* We are copying `obj` to `obj2` using `Object.create()`. Object.create\(\) _copies the existing object to the prototype\(_ _proto\_\_\) of new obj\_\(obj2 in this case\).

```javascript
var obj2 = Object.create(obj);

// obj2 can be visualised as

obj2 = {
     __proto__: {
         a: 5
     }
}
```

* Deleting the property using `delete` operator. This operator _only deletes the value which is present directly on the object_ and does not delete any value present on the prototype\( _\*\*_proto_\_\_\_\) of an object. That is why deleting property `a` does not have any effect.
