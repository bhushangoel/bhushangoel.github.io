What is wrong with this piece of code?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    })
}
```

## Solution:

It won't work as expected, and it will print `5 five times` instead of printing `0 1 2 3 4`.

In this code, `console.log(i)` is written inside `setTimeout` which will execute later, once the execution of `for-loop` finishes, and at that time value of `i` will be equal to `5`\(_exit condition of `for-loop`_\). That is why it will print 5.
