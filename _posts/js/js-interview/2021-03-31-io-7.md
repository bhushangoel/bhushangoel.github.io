What is the length of an array?

```javascript
let arr = [1 , , 3];
console.log(arr.length);   // ?
```

## Solution:

```javascript
let arr = [1 , , 3];
console.log(arr.length);   // 3
```

`arr.length` is 3 and not 2 because `length` property only tracks the highest numeric index within an array. It doesn't loop over an array to count the number of elements. So, any holes within an array will be skipped.

In order to return the count of elements, we might need to write our own custom method.
