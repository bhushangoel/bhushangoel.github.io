Currying is a technique of working with functions. Currying can make a function callable from `f(a, b, c)` to `f(a)(b)(c)`

## A simple example


```javascript
// example 1 - sum(a, b)
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const val = sum(1, 2);
console.log(val);  // 3
```
```javascript
// example 2 - sum(a)(b)
function sum(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const val = sum(1)(2);
console.log(val);  // 3
```

On _line 2_ in *example 2*, we have transformed the `sum` function into `curry` function.

1. When it first called as `sum(1)` on _line 8_, the `argument` passed to it will get saved in the **Lexical Environment**, and a new wrapper is returned `function(b)`.
2. Then this wrapper is called with `2` as an `argument`, and it passes the call to the original `sum`. As the previous value was saved in the **Lexical Environment**, it will be available and `return 3` as an output.

## More advanced example

```js
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    if (b) {
      return add(a + b)
    }
    return a
  }
}

console.log(add(10)(1)());  // 11
```
